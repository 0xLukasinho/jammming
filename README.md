# Welcome to jamming

Jammming is a React-based web application that allows users to search for songs, create playlists, and save them to their Spotify account. I've built this application as a project to practice the usage of reactJS and API implementation. If you would like to try it out, head to: https://0xlukasinho.github.io/jammming/

## Features

- Search Songs: Users can search for songs by entering a song, artist, or album name.
- Create Playlists: Users can create new playlists and add tracks to them.
- Update Playlists: Users can select existing playlists and add songs to them.
- Save to Spotify: Users can save their created playlists directly to their Spotify account.
